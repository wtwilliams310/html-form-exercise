# HTML Forms Mini-Exercise

This is my solution to the HTML Forms Mini-Exercise challenge given in class. The goal was to recreate the inputs for the [Event Vendor Registration Form Template | Jotform](https://www.jotform.com/form-templates/event-vendor-registration-form)

## Overview

This was a challenge to help practice using the HTML form element. CSS was not required. However, I decided to incorporate CSS for practice and to get my solution to look as close to the original as possible within the alloted the class time.

### What I learned

 This challenge allowed me to practice using the following:
- buttons
- flexbox


### Continued development

I want to begin working on using eventListeners instead of onclick. I also will continue working on using flexbox.
